hotfix in fiodl file


1. Some ports name in fiodl are not consistent with the port names in xmi file
	change them to the same name. 
	change the corresponding edge port. 
	
2. 
In actor AbsImpl, there is no impl port connecting input port resx and resy in vertex Abs.
   add the edge:
     edge [] from Abs port resx to AbsImpl port resx
     edge [] from Abs port resy to AbsImpl port resy 

3.
add decision::sdf::BoundedSDFChannel to  GrayScaleToGetPx and GrayScaleToAbs .
add "maximumTokens" to  GrayScaleToGetPx and GrayScaleToAbs 


4. 
 The external data block (channels connected to the outside system)  
 and the local variable in the inline code  cannot have
 the same name.
 
 For example, 
 in vertex A[SDFComb], 
 "inline code":"
 	int x
 "
 there is a variable called "a", as a result, the external data block
 cannot be named as "x".
